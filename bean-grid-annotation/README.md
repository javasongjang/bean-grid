## BeanGrid Annotations ##

BeanGrid Annotations jar consists of all annotations that can be applied on Grid's Items. They're in a separate jar to allow using them in multi module projects where Items don't necessarily have dependencies to Vaadin.

This jar is a dependency of the actual add-on project and it can be used as a dependency of any project defining items requiring use of BeanGrid's annotations.
